In this digital era, image repository is increasing at a tremendous rate. First of all, people have a comparative ease of access to image capturing devices such as smartphones, digital cameras and scanning devices, then what it used to be a few years ago. Not only this, massive amount of data is also generated from medical sciences and satellite imaging every single day. The collection of images available on the internet is also growing at a much faster pace. “According to a study, there are 180 million images on the Web, a total amount of image data of about 3Tb along with 1 million or more digital images are being produced every single day”.Image retrieval performed by matching the feature of a query image with images in the dataset, has become a problem of interest to many people. A lot of research study has been going on in this field to develop systems and tools that shall enable efficient and accurate image browsing and retrieval. For instance, Flipkart had initiated image search on its website but later shut it down in less than a year of its launch because the results that it produced were a lot of times irrelevant and customers did not cater interest in this feature. We therefore, looked into various on going developments in this field and implemented a system that can provide as much best results possible. 

There are two major image retrieval techniques: 

			1)Text based Image Retrieval 

			2)Content Based Image Retrieval 

Text based Image retrieval is retrieval of images based on keywords or annotations that are either added manually to the images or sometimes the text that is associated in the form of subtitle or caption. Keywords are phrases that describe the content in an image. So, all the images in a database have these tags or keywords associated with them that are manually added to describe “what the image contains”. This approach was the most initial methods of retrieval but it has its own disadvantages:

			I. This method is very time consuming and exhaustive.

			II. Sometimes different words have different meanings, therefore it is context driven. This can result in a large number of inaccurate results.

			III. Images might have a subjective matter such as feelings or emotions associated which may be different for different audience. 

CBIR overcomes the limitations of Text Based Retrieval whereby the retrieval occurs on the actual “content” of images that is visible. CBIR works with low-level features such as color, shape or texture.
